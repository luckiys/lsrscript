# lsrscript - Data Science Projects

**Author:** Lakulish Saini

A collection of my favorite R script projects focused on data visualization and analysis using R and ggplot2.

## Overview

This repository contains data science projects exploring real-world datasets including baby name trends, housing market data, and flight delay patterns.

## Projects

### [Project 10: Advanced Plotting with R and ggplot2](./project-10/)

Explores fundamental ggplot2 concepts and visualization techniques:
- **Baby Name Analysis**: Tracking popularity trends of names between 1997 and 2006
- **Letter Distribution**: Analyzing first letter patterns in baby names
- **Gender-Based Analysis**: Comparing naming patterns between males and females
- **Housing Market Scatterplots**: Visualizing Zillow data with color gradients
- **Time Series Visualization**: Tracking median listing prices over time

**Key Skills:**
- `dplyr` data manipulation
- `ggplot2` visualization layers
- Faceting and color scales
- Trend lines and scatterplots

### [Project 11: Advanced Plotting with R and ggplot2 - Part 2](./project-11/)

Continues with more advanced visualization techniques:
- **Boxplots by Region**: Analyzing housing market by U.S. Census regions
- **Supply vs Demand Analysis**: Comparing inventory and days on market
- **Flight Delay Analysis**: Monthly departure and arrival delay trends
- **Airport-Specific Analysis**: Phoenix Sky Harbor delay patterns
- **Good vs Bad Plots**: Understanding effective visualization design

**Key Skills:**
- `tidyr` data reshaping
- `patchwork` for plot composition
- Ribbon plots for variance visualization
- Boxplots and regional analysis

## Technologies Used

- **R** - Statistical programming language
- **ggplot2** - Grammar of graphics visualization
- **dplyr** - Data manipulation
- **tidyr** - Data reshaping
- **patchwork** - Plot composition

## Datasets

1. **SSA Baby Names** - U.S. Social Security Administration name records
2. **Zillow Housing Data** - Real estate market statistics by state
3. **Flight Data** - 1997 U.S. domestic flight records

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install required R packages:
```r
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "tidyr", "patchwork"))
```
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks in each project folder
4. Follow the README instructions in each project directory
